# Tap Me!
Tap Me! is a game that was coded with **Swift 3+**. Do you want to learn to develop a game in Swift? If say yes, good news, this example game will be so useful for you...
 
**Version: 1.1 ðŸŽ‰**

##### You can develop yourself in these topics:
1. Creating timer like encounter and downcounter with Swift 3.0+ // ` NSTimer(); `
2. Creating temporary database with Swift 3.0+ // ` NSUserDefaults(); `
3. Working with functions. // ` func gameSetup(){ .. } `
4. Xcode constraints! :joy:
5. Working with AVFoundation // ` AVAudioPlayer() `
6. And much more!

##### Notes for potential users:
- It can help you to learn and develop applications or maybe games for iOS platform.
- It was coded for GitHub in my free times.
- 2 player mode was not developed yet, maybe in the next version...
- There might be some errors, if you write me, I can fix them.
